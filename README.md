**FEATURE ENGINEERING**

**Business Problem**

We want to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. 
We will perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

**Data Set**

The dataset is part of a larger dataset held by the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the US. 
The data used for a diabetes study on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the US state of Arizona. 
The target variable is "outcome", where 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result and 0 indicates a negative result.

**Pregnancies:** Number of pregnancies

**Glucose:** 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test

**Blood Pressure:** Blood Pressure (diastolic blood pressure) (mm Hg)

**SkinThickness:** Skin Thickness

**Insulin:** 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

**DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Function (2-hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test)

**BMI:** Body mass

**Age:** Age

**Outcome:** Have disease (1) or not (0)
